## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emmanuel O Eboh.
I'm a React and Solidity developer, additionally, I'm a technical writer.
I love the web and I love creating solutions for the web. 

To me, software engineering is not just about the code, but also about the 
thoughts that comes before and after the code; this led me into technical writing. I write on front-end and web 3.0 technologies.

## My Story
My first interest in coding was as far back in 2016, when I saw young pre-teens 
building various applications at CcHub. An 18 year old me was inspired.

However, it was not until 2019 before I wrote my first line of code (HTML and CSS).
After a year of mark-up and styling, I started learning JavaScript during the start of the 
pandemic. 
In January,2022 I have started learning Solidity for Ethereum Blockchain development.

It has been an interesting journey so far, I've learned, I've been frustrated, I've relearned
and I have gotten better than ever.

## Hobbies
I play basketball and chess as hobbies. I would love to live in San Francisco one day.
