### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a React and Solidity developer, additionally, I'm a technical writer.
I love the web and I love creating solutions for the web. 

To me, software engineering is not just about the code, but also about the 
thoughts that comes before and after the code; That's why I also have a passion
for technical writing. I write on front-end and web 3.0 technologies.


I play basketball and chess as hobbies. I would love to live in San Francisco one day.
