## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emmanuel O Eboh.
I'm a React and JavaScript developer, additionally, I'm a technical writer.
I love the web and I love creating solutions for the web. 

To me, software engineering is not just about the code, but also about the 
thoughts that comes before and after the code; this led me into technical writing. I write on front-end and web 3.0 technologies.

## My Story
My first interest in coding was as far back in 2016, when I saw young pre-teens 
building various applications at CcHub. An 18 year old me was inspired.

However, it was not until 2019 before I wrote my first line of code (HTML and CSS).
After a year of mark-up and styling, I started learning JavaScript during the start of the 
pandemic. 
Currently, I'm learning Typescript and Solidity.

It has been an interesting journey so far, I've learned, I've been frustrated, I've relearned
and I have gotten better than ever.

## Hobbies
I play basketball and chess as hobbies. I would love to live in San Francisco one day.

## Technical Writing
I'm also a technical writer, I write on front-end technologies, user documentations and guides, web 3.0 etc
